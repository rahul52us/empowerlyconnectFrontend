      "review_text": "My first pair of Jordan 1 Highs! These are very high-quality sneakers. My only real complaint is that the price is very steep. Otherwise, great sneakers that arrived in a timely manner and in pristine condition! The premium(?) leather is very crease-resistant. I don’t really mind creasing - I think of it as a badge of honor because it shows you wear your shoes - but I say that because I’ve worn them six times now and they still look fresh out the box! Plus, the suede is very easy to clean. (I got a drip of salsa on my drip, but a slightly damp paper towel followed up with a dry one cleared it right up and it looks like it never happened!) Definitely my favorite pair of sneakers. 10/10 highly recommend, especially for sneakerheads in training like me. :)",
